# Rhode Skin’s European Roadblock and Strategic Glow-Up  💄

## 🧠 Executive Summary

Rhode Skin — known for its viral “glazed” aesthetic and cult-favorite lip products — faces a major barrier in its international growth: legal restrictions tied to its brand name in the European market. This case study explores how a trademark issue in Europe has impacted Rhode’s retail presence and outlines a smart, data-informed roadmap for unlocking the €96B European beauty market.

## 📍 The Problem: Legal Roadblock, Not Supply Chain

Despite global online buzz, Rhode Skin remains absent from major physical retail spaces across Europe:

- ❌ No shelf space in Ireland
- ❌ No beauty aisle presence in most of the EU
- ❌ No impulse purchases at leading cosmetics chains

**The reason?**  
A trademark conflict — “Rhode” is already registered as a fashion brand name in Europe, limiting Rhode Skin’s expansion options.
