# Rhode Skin‚Äôs European Roadblock and Strategic Glow-Up 

## Introduction

Rhode Skincare known for its viral ‚Äúglazed‚Äù aesthetic and food flavoured lip products faces a major barrier in its international growth: legal restrictions tied to its brand name in the European market. 

This case study explores how a trademark issue in Europe has impacted Rhode‚Äôs retail presence and **outlines** a smart, data-informed roadmap for unlocking the ‚Ç¨96B European beauty market.



## The Problem: Legal Roadblock, Not Supply Chain

Despite global online buzz, Rhode Skin remains absent from major physical retail spaces across Europe:

- *No shelf space in Ireland.*
- *No beauty aisle presence across most of Europe.*
- *No impulse purchases at leading cosmetics chains.*

**The Root cause?**  
A trademark conflict. ‚ÄúRhode‚Äù is already registered as a fashion brand name in Europe, limiting Rhode Skin‚Äôs expansion options.



## Missed Market Opportunity üåç 

Europe‚Äôs beauty and skincare market is valued at **‚Ç¨96 billion**. Rhode's share? A drop of glazed lip oil.

**Top 6 Markets by Value:**

| Country       | Market Value (‚Ç¨B) |
|---------------|-------------------|
| Germany       | 15.9              |
| France        | 13.7              |
| Italy         | 12.5              |
| UK            | 11.0              |
| Spain         | 10.4              |
| Poland        | 5.2               |


That‚Äôs a lot of missed ~~moments~~ moisturization.
